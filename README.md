<h2 id="about">Project Description:</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing data from a real-world bank marketing campaign aimed at encouraging clients to open deposits. The goal is to identify key customer characteristics that indicate a higher likelihood of responding positively to the offer, and to build a machine learning model that predicts client behavior based on these features. The project covers all key steps, from data preprocessing to model development and optimization using ensemble methods.

<h2 id="case">Business Case:</h2>
Business Objective: Help the bank target customers more effectively by identifying those most likely to respond to deposit offers, thereby improving marketing efficiency.

Technical Objective: Develop and optimize a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a client will respond to the deposit offer based on their profile and behavior.

<h2 id="data_info">Data Overview:</h2>
The dataset contains client demographic and behavioral information, as well as the outcome of the latest direct marketing campaign. The target variable is whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no).

<h2 id="requirements">Project Workflow:</h2>
